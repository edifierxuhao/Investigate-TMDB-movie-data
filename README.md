# Investigate-TMDB-movie-data
Investigate TMDB movie data is my submmited project for introduction of data analysis in udacity's data analysis nanodegree program

## Introduction
I down load the dataset from kaggle, this data set contains information about more than 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.
I want use columns such as ratings, revenue, runtime, genres ect to investgate the following questions:
What kind of properties are associated with revenue?
What kind of properties are associated with vote?
How genres prefenrnce changed form year to year?

## Tools I used
I used pandas, numpy, random, matplotlib to do the analysis, and used jupyter notebook to run all the code.

## Process
I followed the gathering, wrangling, analyzing and visualizing four steps to do the processing.
